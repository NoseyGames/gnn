# PRIVACY POLICY
gn-math
Last updated: November 28, 2025
We keep this short because we barely collect anything.
In plain English:

We do not ask for your name, email, address, or any personal details.
We do not use accounts, logins, or registration forms.
We do not process any sensitive personal information (race, religion, sexual orientation, health data, etc.).
We do not receive data about you from third parties.
We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to anyone for marketing or any other purpose.

What we automatically collect (standard for any website):

Basic server logs: IP address, browser type, pages visited, time of visit.
Google Analytics (completely anonymized – your IP is masked before storage).
A few first-party cookies that remember your preferred theme (light/dark) and language – nothing else.

That’s it. These logs and analytics are only used to keep the site running, fix bugs, and see which math pages are most popular.
Cookies & tracking

We use the minimum possible: one cookie for site settings, Google Analytics (anonymized), and MathJax CDN for rendering equations.
You can opt out of Google Analytics at any time: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
You can delete or block all cookies in your browser – the site will still work perfectly.

Google API usage
When we load book covers or previews via Google services, we follow Google’s API Services User Data Policy and its Limited Use requirements.
How long we keep data
Server logs: maximum 30 days.
Google Analytics data: anonymized immediately and retained under Google’s own policy.
Your rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
Even though we collect almost nothing identifiable, you still have full rights:

Access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, objection – whatever applies in your country.
To exercise any right, just join our Discord and message a staff member: https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n
We’ll handle it within 30 days (usually much faster).

Third-party links
Our pages may link to GitHub, jsDelivr, Wikipedia, or other external sites. Once you leave gn-math, their privacy policies apply – we have no control over them.
Children
The site is pure educational content and does not target children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
Changes to this policy
If we ever make a meaningful change, we’ll update the “Last updated” date
